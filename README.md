# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to analyze and understand crowdfunding data to determine if there are specific factors that make a projects’s campaign successful. The projects we are analyzing have a variety of categories such as film, theater, technology, publishing, music, games, food, and photography. We are using the data collected in this analysis to make decisions on how to crowdfund a campaign for a new play titled Fever. The playwright, Louise, is estimating a budget of over $10,000 for the play Fever.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this portion of the project we created a line graph titled “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date”. This graph shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays per month. The data for this graph was pulled from a pivot chart that can be filtered by parent category and year. The parent category was filtered for “theater”.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this portion of the project we created a line graph titled “Outcomes Based on Goal”. On the x-axis the graph has the goal amount ranges. On the y-axis the graph shows the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects. This graph helps visualize the relationship between the goal amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One difficulty that can be encountered stems from working on an excel project and utilizing multiple sheets. This project had up to 11 different sheets at one point. It’s easy to get confused between the sheets and accidentally call data from the wrong one. One way to overcome this is to rename the sheets unique names that makes it clear as to what that sheet holds. Also, its important to check your work and make sure that all the data makes sense. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From the line graph for the Outcomes Based on Launch Date we see that the success or failure of a play is not correlated with the launch date. There are failed and successful plays throughout the whole year. From late spring to the end of summer there is a strong uptick of plays trying to launch. The summer months are likely peak months for theater entertainment, hence playwrights try to launch during that timeframe. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Overall, in this data set we see that there is a downward trend of successful projects. As the pledged goal increases we see that the percentage failed increases too. There are some outliers at the goal of 35000 to 39999 and at the goal of 40000 to 44999. These two outliers could be explained for different reasons such as the playwrights were highly successful and well known so that patrons were more likely to donate to those funds than other ones. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The kickstarter data set provides a lot of quantitative  information such as the the goal amount, the pledged amount, dates, backer counts, and average donations. It also includes qualitative data such as the play name and a description of the play. All of this quantitative data and qualitative data is useful but there is still some limitations of this dataset. For example, one play might be more successful in crowdfunding because the is a seasoned professional who is well-established and popular among theater patrons. Patrons could be more inclined to donate to a well-known playwright than to a novice one. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create graphs based on other categories and subcategories. Are people willingly donating to fund theater projects like the one Louise is working on, or are they more interested in film projects?
